# Status assessment – Phase 4 quality and release readiness

## Overview
This assessment reviews the Hadeda package against the roadmap captured in
[`workplan.md`](../workplan.md) and confirms the state of documentation and test
coverage ahead of release activities.

## Roadmap alignment
- **Phases 1–3** – All foundational transports and endpoint helpers are present
  in `R/`, covering accounts, transactions, tokens, contracts, crypto, files,
  schedules, and consensus flows as planned. Exported functions in
  [`NAMESPACE`](../NAMESPACE) map cleanly to the verbs delivered across these
  phases.
- **Phase 4 Step 11 (Testing & validation)** – Unit and snapshot suites span the
  major domains with 574 assertions and only the two optional integration tests
  skipped when Hedera credentials are absent.【600c04†L1-L12】 The CI workflow in
  [`.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml`](../.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml)
  keeps `R CMD check` coverage in place.
- **Phase 4 Step 12 (Documentation)** – All exported objects now have roxygen
  coverage; running `devtools::document()` produces a complete set of Rd files
  including the service-level overview for contracts.【8876f8†L1-L4】【F:man/contract_service.Rd†L1-L9】
  The pkgdown configuration exposes reference sections and the user-journey
  vignette set for release.【F:pkgdown/_pkgdown.yml†L1-L42】【F:vignettes/hadeda-getting-started.Rmd†L1-L79】
- **Phase 4 Step 13 (Release preparation)** – README and NEWS capture the current
  feature set and release notes, and pkgdown metadata is staged. Additional
  release engineering (site build, CRAN policies) remains outstanding before
  publication.【F:README.md†L1-L120】【F:NEWS.md†L1-L14】

## Documentation inventory
- **Reference documentation** – `devtools::document()` regenerates Rd pages for
  every exported helper, including the refreshed transaction record arguments and
  the new `contract_service` overview.【F:man/crypto_transaction_record.Rd†L1-L24】【F:man/crypto_transaction_records.Rd†L1-L25】【F:man/contract_service.Rd†L1-L9】
- **Vignettes** – Six rendered guides cover onboarding, topics, transactions,
  tokens, contracts, and gRPC environment preparation, fulfilling the user
  journey goals for Step 12.【F:vignettes/hadeda-getting-started.Rmd†L1-L79】【F:docs/environment-grpc-testing.md†L1-L78】
- **Architecture notes** – Supporting documentation in `docs/` records the
  landscape analysis and functional architecture commitments that shaped Phases 1
  and 2.【F:docs/function-architecture.md†L1-L87】

## Risks and follow-ups
- **gRPC integration coverage** – The consensus integration test still skips
  because it requires a configured gRPC handler; end-to-end validation should be
  exercised once signing helpers are wired for a testnet account.【F:tests/testthat/test-integration.R†L1-L30】
- **Release collateral** – The pkgdown site has not yet been rendered into the
  `docs/` directory because `.Rbuildignore` excludes it. A publication pass should
  render the site, audit assets, and confirm badges/links before tagging a
  release.【F:.Rbuildignore†L1-L7】
- **NAMESPACE management** – The current `NAMESPACE` is still hand-maintained and
  flagged by roxygen; migrating to roxygen-managed exports would remove manual
  drift risk during future additions.【F:NAMESPACE†L1-L67】

## Recommended next steps
1. Configure a gRPC signing handler for automated testing and unskip the
   consensus submission integration once credentials are provisioned.
2. Run `R CMD check` locally using the release target R version and address any
   notes before the pkgdown build.
3. Render the pkgdown site (`pkgdown::build_site()`) and host it either via the
   `docs/` directory or GitHub Pages branch, updating badges and the README with
   the final site URL.
4. Transition `NAMESPACE` to roxygen management and add a short maintainer guide
   documenting how to regenerate documentation and run quality checks.
5. Finalise release collateral: update `NEWS.md` with release highlights, bump
   the version in `DESCRIPTION`, and draft a submission checklist aligned with
   CRAN policies.
